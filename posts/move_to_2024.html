<h1>Moving to 2024</h1>
<p>Here is the traditional end-of-the-year and New Year’s expectations post.</p>
<p>This will be the third time I wrote consecutively, you can see other posts also on Medium.</p>

<h2>Looking back to 2023</h2>
<p>2023 was a tough year, I believe COVID lockdowns were taking their toll. On one hand, I had some health issues mostly caused by a sedentary lifestyle and working with computers. On the other hand, <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/">Google announced layoffs</a> during my probation period and it created a lot of stress for me. In the end, I was not one of the affected employees, but until the air cleared off I was quite stressed.</p>
<h3>How much have I completed my targets?</h3>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My average step count is 5800 and my daily target is 8000. I think that is more than hitting the target at least 4 days a week. PASS  </li>
<li>Most weeks I did 2 exercises per week. So I missed this target. FAIL  </li>
<li>My current BMI is 25.9 so it’s above the target range, FAIL  </li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to <strong>reading</strong>, I did better than in 2022 but have not hit my target yet. My target was 24 but I finished 15 books which is nice. FAIL</p>
<p><strong>Financial</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I did the monthly contributions quite regularly, if I miss a month the next month I compensate for that. PASS  </li>
<li>Emergency funds are fluctuating but can be considered okay. PASS  </li>
<li>My only side hustle was blogging here. And I was able to collect $102 and my target was $100. PASS  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote, including this one, 18 articles on Medium. PASS  </li>
<li>I did not count how many posts I sent out on X but for sure I was more active, especially after removing Instagram and LinkedIn applications from my phone, X is the only social network application on my phone. PASS  </li>
<li>I was definitely not active on YouTube as a creator. FAIL  </li>
</ul>
<p>So if I only consider PASS / FAIL counts I was able to hit 60% of my targets. And I would consider this as a successful year.</p>
<h2>Here comes 2024</h2>
<p>This year I will focus on fitness more than in 2022 and 2023. So my priority targets will be around that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will have at least 4 active days in a week. An active day means at least 20 minutes of exercise.  </li>
<li>At least once a week, I will walk or run at least 5 km.  </li>
<li>I will try to follow a Mediterranean diet. So more salads and vegetables, more fish, less red meat.  </li>
<li>I will reduce my alcohol intake from around once a week to once a month.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I also have some technical goals  </p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification  </li>
<li>Getting more experience with Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow  </li>
<li>Getting more experience with streaming data  </li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to creator goals, this year they are also tech related</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to create two Android apps  </li>
<li>I will build these in public and share the development on <a href="http://build.canburaktumer.com">build.canburaktumer.com</a>  </li>
<li>I will align with <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted">Scott Hanselman’s advice</a> and move a copy of my blog posts to <a href="http://archive.canburaktumer.com">archive.canburaktumer.com</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>This year I do not have any financial goals. I will try to save and invest, but there are other priorities at the moment.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although 2023 was not easy, it was a successful year in my opinion. I have high hopes for 2024, let’s see what it will bring.</p>
