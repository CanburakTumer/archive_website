# Moving to 2024 

Here is the traditional end-of-the-year and New Year’s expectations post.

This will be the third time I wrote consecutively, you can see other posts also on Medium.

## Looking back to 2023
2023 was a tough year, I believe COVID lockdowns were taking their toll. On one hand, I had some health issues mostly caused by a sedentary lifestyle and working with computers. On the other hand, [Google announced layoffs](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/) during my probation period and it created a lot of stress for me. In the end, I was not one of the affected employees, but until the air cleared off I was quite stressed.

### How much have I completed my targets?
**Health**

- My average step count is 5800 and my daily target is 8000. I think that is more than hitting the target at least 4 days a week. PASS  
- Most weeks I did 2 exercises per week. So I missed this target. FAIL  
- My current BMI is 25.9 so it’s above the target range, FAIL  

When it comes to **reading**, I did better than in 2022 but have not hit my target yet. My target was 24 but I finished 15 books which is nice. FAIL

**Financial**

- I did the monthly contributions quite regularly, if I miss a month the next month I compensate for that. PASS  
- Emergency funds are fluctuating but can be considered okay. PASS  
- My only side hustle was blogging here. And I was able to collect $102 and my target was $100. PASS  

**Creator**

- I wrote, including this one, 18 articles on Medium. PASS  
- I did not count how many posts I sent out on X but for sure I was more active, especially after removing Instagram and LinkedIn applications from my phone, X is the only social network application on my phone. PASS  
- I was definitely not active on YouTube as a creator. FAIL  

So if I only consider PASS / FAIL counts I was able to hit 60% of my targets. And I would consider this as a successful year.

## Here comes 2024
This year I will focus on fitness more than in 2022 and 2023. So my priority targets will be around that.

- I will have at least 4 active days in a week. An active day means at least 20 minutes of exercise.  
- At least once a week, I will walk or run at least 5 km.  
- I will try to follow a Mediterranean diet. So more salads and vegetables, more fish, less red meat.  
- I will reduce my alcohol intake from around once a week to once a month.  

I also have some technical goals  

- Getting the Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification  
- Getting more experience with Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow  
- Getting more experience with streaming data  

When it comes to creator goals, this year they are also tech related

- I want to create two Android apps  
- I will build these in public and share the development on [build.canburaktumer.com](http://build.canburaktumer.com)  
- I will align with [Scott Hanselman’s advice](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted) and move a copy of my blog posts to [archive.canburaktumer.com](http://archive.canburaktumer.com)  

This year I do not have any financial goals. I will try to save and invest, but there are other priorities at the moment.

## Conclusion
Although 2023 was not easy, it was a successful year in my opinion. I have high hopes for 2024, let’s see what it will bring.
