# Test post with Tiniest Static Website Generator.

This is only a test post to try out my own [Static Website Generator.](https://github.com/CanburakTumer/tiniest_static_website/tree/main)  

I was planning to use Hugo for this blog archive, but it got more complex then I wish for a simple archive. Hence I patched my own generator quickly.

I will be adding my older blog posts with time.

Cheers!
