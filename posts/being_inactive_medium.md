# How being inactive on Medium affects views

I am publishing on Medium since 2018. I am not a very active writer on the platform and I have my high and low seasons as a content creator. Since September 2022, I opted-in for the Medium Partner Program to motivate myself and earn some money for my effort.

In the first 6 months of 2023, I have published 12 articles some were free some were member-only. During june my productivity started to fall, and I did not publish all July and August.

Apparently this inactivity is also reflected on the view numbers. Even my very successful -in my terms- and revenue generating post stopped generating anything at all.

Below you can see how drastically the earnings change when I slowed down. And note that some of the earnings are coming from Referrals.

During my “high” season where I was publishing around 2 articles per month, I was getting around 100 views per day average and I was not doing a great marketing. I was just sending a link to Twitter and LinkedIn about the post I just published.

When I started to create less, I see the instant effect on the statistics. My articles were being visited less and less everyday, but still it was ok-ish. And I knew the high season will arrive again.

After two months of radio silence, statistics dropped a bit more and even though there are some visits and reads to the articles. They almost stopped generating the revenue. I think this is also related to revenue sharing changes Medium did in July. They rightfully want to share their revenue with active writers.

## What’s next for me
Well, first of all I love knowledge sharing and content creation. So I will stay on this platform, I will still have high and low seasons so my statistics will fluctuate I will accept this.

But I can take a few precautions like writing and saving drafts during high seasons for low seasons. So I can have a more balanced writing schedule. This way you can also expect a more consistent publish schedule from me.
