<h1>How being inactive on Medium affects views</h1>
<p>I am publishing on Medium since 2018. I am not a very active writer on the platform and I have my high and low seasons as a content creator. Since September 2022, I opted-in for the Medium Partner Program to motivate myself and earn some money for my effort.</p>
<p>In the first 6 months of 2023, I have published 12 articles some were free some were member-only. During june my productivity started to fall, and I did not publish all July and August.</p>
<p>Apparently this inactivity is also reflected on the view numbers. Even my very successful -in my terms- and revenue generating post stopped generating anything at all.</p>
<p>Below you can see how drastically the earnings change when I slowed down. And note that some of the earnings are coming from Referrals.</p>
<p>During my “high” season where I was publishing around 2 articles per month, I was getting around 100 views per day average and I was not doing a great marketing. I was just sending a link to Twitter and LinkedIn about the post I just published.</p>
<p>When I started to create less, I see the instant effect on the statistics. My articles were being visited less and less everyday, but still it was ok-ish. And I knew the high season will arrive again.</p>
<p>After two months of radio silence, statistics dropped a bit more and even though there are some visits and reads to the articles. They almost stopped generating the revenue. I think this is also related to revenue sharing changes Medium did in July. They rightfully want to share their revenue with active writers.</p>
<h2>What’s next for me</h2>
<p>Well, first of all I love knowledge sharing and content creation. So I will stay on this platform, I will still have high and low seasons so my statistics will fluctuate I will accept this.</p>
<p>But I can take a few precautions like writing and saving drafts during high seasons for low seasons. So I can have a more balanced writing schedule. This way you can also expect a more consistent publish schedule from me.</p>
<p>If you like my posts, follow me for the future ones. Also I am adding a few below which might be interesting for you. Thanks for reading so far!</p>
